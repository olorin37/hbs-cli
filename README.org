* Simple Handlebars CLI (in Rust)

Simple CLI for generating text from handlebars (or Mustache) templates,
by feeding them with data from file (YAML parser used is for it, so JSON
also supported), writen in Rust programming language (with usage serde_yaml
and handlebars crates).

** Usage

#+begin_src bash
hbs-cli <properties file> <template file> > <output file>
#+end_src

Where ~<properties file>~ can be ether YAML or JSON (as YAML parser
is a JSON parser too) and ~<template file>~ is handlebars template
(so Mustache templates should work also). Template is generated on
standard output.

** Building

#+begin_src bash
cargo build --release  # for release binary
#+end_src
